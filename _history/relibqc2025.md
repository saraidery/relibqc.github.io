# Welcome to the Reusable libraries in quantum chemistry 2025 Conference!

The purpose of this meeting is to catalyze discussions within the quantum chemistry community on the potential of new reusable libraries, following the main organizer's recent call to arms in [J. Chem. Phys. 159, 180901 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0175165). Reusable libraries exhibit great promise in reducing maintenance costs of quantum chemical software, and accelerate the development of science. The meeting thus has an explicit focus on enabling discussions and networking between various projects, which can result in the development of new reusable libraries for novel topics.

Following the example of computer science meetings, the main focus of the conference is on poster sessions in order to maximize the number of presentations at the meeting and to enable in-person discussions between the participants. Our aim is to allow all attendees to present a poster.

We welcome anyone interested in quantum chemistry software development to participate. We hope to attract both seasoned senior developers of established open source and commercial packages, as well as advanced graduate students and postdocs in the meeting to talk about best practices in quantum chemical software development. Our target audience is people who are already working on quantum chemistry software development. While we especially hope to attract developers of existing program packages or open source libraries, as our aim is also to enable the networking necessary to form novel initiatives that have the potential to revolutionize how quantum chemistry software is developed, people working in commercial or closed-source packages are also welcome to attend the meeting, especially if they are open to developing with or relying on novel open source libraries in their projects.

The meeting will be held at the [Majvik Conference Center](https://majvik.fi/), which is situated in beautiful nature a half hour's distance from the Helsinki international airport. The isolated setting with full room and board will allow excellent opportunities to network with colleagues working within quantum chemistry software development.

## Invitation letters


If you need an invitation letter to get a visa or funding to attend the meeting, please contact Susi Lehtola directly.

 
## Registration

Late registration is still possible. We can fit around 100 participants. The registration is on a first come, first served basis. The conference fee is 625 € which includes coffee breaks, lunches, and dinners for the meeting. Late registration closes on 31 May 2025.

Participants will also have to separately book and pay for housing at Majvik. The conference rate is 115 €/night for single rooms, and 140 €/night for double rooms; these prices include breakfast, completing the full room and board. The housing reservation is done via email, mention the conference booking code 63580 in your message. Book your housing before the conference quota terminates on 31 May 2025!

Note: the conference does not employ any conference or travel agency. Please disregard any emails you get about organizing accommodation for the conference, as these are from scammers. Book your rooms directly at Majvik with the above instructions. 

 
## Abstract submission

Late abstract submission is still possible. Abstracts are submitted using Google Form. Please use the [attached template for abstract submission](link). 

The conference program was prepared based on abstracts submitted before May 5 2025. Poster submissions are still welcomed until 31 May 2025; you will be able to present your poster at the meeting. Your poster abstract will be included in the final conference program, as long as you register to the conference.

## Participant query

A key consideration in planning the conference is the participant query. If you are attending the meeting and have not yet answered the query (which was initially sent by email), please use the linked [Google Form](link).

 
## Travel

N.B. Even though Majvik is relatively close to the Masala train station, there are no commuter trains during the conference due to a maintenance break 23.6.-27.7.2025.

However, Majvik is a short taxi ride away from the Helsinki-Vantaa international airport, which has connections to most major international hubs. Note that Uber is legal in Finland, and we recommend using it to avoid potential issues with unregulated taxis on the free market.

We will organize pooled taxis or bus transport to the airport or to downtown Helsinki at the end of the meeting, 16:00 on Thursday July 3. You should reach the airport around 16:30, and be able to catch an evening flight to major European hubs.
 
## Timetable

The meeting begins with a welcome dinner reception at 18:00 local time on Sunday June 29 2025. The meeting ends at 16:00 local time on Thursday July 3 2025. Please book your flights so that you can attend the whole of the meeting.

The final program is now available in the [book of abstracts](link). The time table is shown below for reference.

* Keynote talks are 45 minutes each, with a dedicated discussion session
* Contributed talks are 30 minutes each, followed by 15 minutes of discussion.
* Short talks are 23 minutes each, followed by 7 minutes of discussion.
* Flash talks are 12 minutes each, followed by 3 minutes of discussion.

The talk timings will be strict to allow sufficient time for discussions, which are the main aim of the meeting.

Posters: everyone is welcome to present a poster. The poster boards are large enough to fit posters in A0 format in portrait mode. There will be poster prizes for the best young male, and the best young female presenter, sponsored by the [Journal of Chemical Physics](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/).
