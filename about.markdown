The purpose of ReLibQC is to catalyze discussions within the quantum chemistry community on the potential of new reusable libraries, following the recent call to arms in [J. Chem. Phys. 159, 180901 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0175165). Reusable libraries exhibit great promise in reducing maintenance costs of quantum chemical software, and accelerate the development of science. The ReLibQc meeting series thus has an explicit focus on enabling discussions and networking between various projects, which can result in the development of new reusable libraries for novel topics.
